# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Architecture

**Dew** is a minimal expression language. Small, ephemeral, perfectly formed—like a droplet condensed from logic. Just dew it.

Functions + numeric values, compiled to multiple backends (WGSL, Cranelift, Lua).

**Crate structure:**
- `dew-core` - Core AST, types, and expression representation
- `dew-cond` - Conditional backend helpers for domain crates
- `dew-scalar` - Standard scalar math functions (sin, cos, etc.)
- `dew-linalg` - Linear algebra types and operations
- `dew-complex` - Complex number operations
- `dew-quaternion` - Quaternion operations

Backends (wgsl, lua, cranelift) are feature flags within each domain crate.

## Core Rule

**Keep docs in sync:** When adding crates or features, update README.md and docs/.

**Note things down immediately:**
- Bugs/issues -> fix or add to TODO.md
- Design decisions -> docs/ or code comments
- Future work -> TODO.md
- Key insights -> this file

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered -> document before proceeding.

**Don't say these (edit first):** "Fair point", "Should have", "That should go in X" -> edit the file BEFORE responding.

**Do the work properly.** When asked to analyze X, actually read X - don't synthesize from conversation. The cost of doing it right < redoing it.

**If citing CLAUDE.md after failing:** The file failed its purpose. Adjust it to actually prevent the failure.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Create special cases - design to avoid them
- Create legacy APIs - one API, update all callers
- Add to the monolith - split by domain into sub-crates
- Do half measures - migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction
- Ask permission when philosophy is clear - just do it
- Return tuples - use structs with named fields
- Mark as done prematurely - note what remains
- Fear "over-modularization" - 100 lines is fine for a module
- Consider time constraints - we're NOT short on time; optimize for correctness
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** Functions > traits until you need the trait. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem?
